Manojsai Bangaru's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This site showcases my skills, experience, and projects as a cybersecurity professional specializing in SOC operations, Splunk, and SOAR automation.

**📖 Overview**
This portfolio was built to create a professional online presence for my cybersecurity career. It highlights my expertise in tools like Splunk and Splunk SOAR, my experience as a Security Delivery Associate at Accenture, and my certifications such as CompTIA Security+ CE. The site includes sections for my work, skills, experience, certifications, and a contact form for collaboration opportunities.

Modern Design: A clean, professional layout with a vibrant color scheme (dark background with gradient accents).
Dynamic Hero Section: Uses Typed.js to cycle through my roles (SOC Analyst, Playbook Developer) with a fade effect.
Interactive Animations: AOS library for fade-up animations on scroll, enhancing user experience on desktop.
Responsive Layout: Fully optimized for mobile and desktop, with media queries ensuring proper alignment and readability.
Contact Form: Integrated with Formspree (linked to manojsaibangaru@gmail.com) for easy communication.
Projects Showcase: A dedicated page (projects.html) to display cybersecurity projects like the AI-Powered Threat Detection Dashboard.
Resume Download: A link to download my resume directly from the site.
Social Links: GitHub and LinkedIn profiles for networking.

**🛠️ Technologies Used**

HTML5 & CSS3: For structure and styling.
JavaScript: For interactivity (Typed.js for text animation, AOS for scroll animations).

**🚀 Development Journey**

This portfolio was a collaborative effort with Grok (xAI) over several sessions in April 2025. Here’s a summary of the work we did together:

**Initial Setup (April 11-12, 2025):**

Planned and designed a portfolio with sections for Home, Projects, Skills, Experience, Certifications, and Contact.
Built the initial site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a modern, colorful, and professional style.
Added a contact form using Formspree, linked to manojsaibangaru@gmail.com.
Deployed the site on GitHub Pages for free hosting.


**Enhancements (April 12-13, 2025):**

Added interactivity with AOS for scroll animations and Typed.js for a dynamic hero section cycling through roles.
Fixed visibility issues with sections like "What I Do," "Tech Stack," and "Contact Form" by adjusting CSS and JavaScript.
Improved mobile responsiveness, ensuring proper alignment, text readability, and image display on smaller screens.
Balanced desktop and mobile layouts to prevent design breaks across devices.
Added images (GitHub logo, LinkedIn logo, profile photo) and ensured they displayed correctly.


Final Touches (April 22, 2025):

Enhanced desktop animations on the homepage, with staggered AOS effects and smoother Typed.js transitions.
Created the "My Work" page (projects.html) to showcase cybersecurity projects like the AI-Powered Threat Detection Dashboard.
Maintained mobile responsiveness, ensuring the site looks clean and professional on all devices.
